# acmsteam-fix
Launch fix to "Aliens: Colonial Marines" for Steam.

For some people A:CM relaunches every time you quit the game... there are many tips to "fix" this, but they either don't or just temporarily fix the problem. 

You can use my already compiled executable or make your own using my source code, thats up to you.

How to:

* Make sure you make Steam check the integrity of the files of A:CM
* Open the folder where the ACM.exe is located: Normally, this folder is "Aliens Colonial Marines\Binaries\Win32".
* Rename the existing ACM.exe to _ACM.exe
* Put the downloaded/compiled ACM.exe into this folder, now you have ACM.exe and _ACM.exe in the same folder.
* There is no need to check "compatibility mode" nor "run as administrator" for both files.
* Enjoy


Final thoughts...

* You need to reapply this fix again if you need to recheck the game integrity, because STEAM will download the original "ACM.exe" again.
* Use it until GearBox releases a patch. If they're going to release one...
